# Intro

I'm a passionate and results-driven data scientist and information sciences student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. With a strong foundation in data analysis and visualization, machine learning, and statistical modeling, I am dedicated to leveraging my skills to make a lasting impact in the field. I am particularly interested in projects with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.

# Some history

- The first OS I had touched was Windows XP in 2008 in India-My first interaction with a personal computer. 

- My first experience with a video game was Road Rash, a Bike Racing game that came out in 1991. Used to compete with my family every weekend.

- In the summer of 2012, my dad bought his first ever smartphone, The Samsung Galaxy S3. Still remember how surprised I was when I realized anyone could see my house on Google Maps on thier phones. 

- At the age of 11, I persuaded my dad to purchase my very first iPad, marking the beginning of my ownership of smart technology.

- At 13, I finally moved to the United States and was constatly shocked and surprised by new types of technology every day that I have never seen before. Some examples include, i-pass, infotainment systems in cars, and Netflix.

- I was 14 when I first received my personal computer—an old Dell laptop provided by my middle school—and I was thrilled to have it. I primarily used it for web surfing, writing essays, and utilizing Rosetta Stone to enhance my communication skills.

- I was introduced to programming at the age of 15, and my passion for it began to grow. I took my first computer science course in high school, starting with Scratch and gradually progressing to writing code in Python by the end of the course.

- During my senior year of High School, I finally trained and achieved my goal of breaking 54 seconds in the 400 meter race. 

- At the age of 16, I made a pivotal decision to embark on a career in computer science, which led me to enroll at Northern Illinois University with a clear goal in mind: majoring in Computer Science. This choice marked the beginning of an exciting journey where I would delve into the world of programming, algorithms, and cutting-edge technologies.

- Towards the end of my first semester at NIU I enrolled in a six week power course on Data Science. I gained exposure to Data Science and loved doing research using programming which led to me to change my career path towards Data Science.

- I was 18 When I joined my first ever independent research study, I did research on Parkinson's disease and was part of a team developing a wearable to help predict individuals with Parkinson's disease. 

- I was 19 When I finished my first college level course in Data Science and was certified in topics such as EDA, Python for Data Science and Supervised Machine Learning models.
